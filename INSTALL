How to get fuse running:

1) get the fuse 2.2 source from http://fuse.sf.net/ and install according to its INSTALL file

2) make a mountpoint - the example reflect file system uses /mnt/fuse

3) fusermount -u /mnt/fuse (just in case you have another running :)

4) tclsh reflect.tcl

You should then be able to interact with /mnt/fuse as a directory of files.
